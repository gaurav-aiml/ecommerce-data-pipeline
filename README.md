As a Data Engineer for a fictional E-commerce startup, this project addresses the task of creating a Data Pipeline which transports the web logs that are generated by the servers to Google Big Query (used as a data warehouse). This datawarehouse will help analysts to gain insights like the number of product pages visited by users, the number of items in the cart per hour or any other ad-hoc query needed for other business requirements.
